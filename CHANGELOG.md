## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A seven-step PDF-to-buckets walkthrough with a real rendered two-page paper, source highlights, author-role annotations, typed formula/primitive inspection, ambiguity experiments, lemma/theorem checks, missing-premise diagnostics, real RFC/personal bucket formation, coherent forks, and exports that restore in the main workbench.
- Interactive paper/bucket coherence visualizations: exact conflict groups, a claim-by-position SAT matrix with source inspection and repair highlights, plus version/fork trajectories linked to comparisons. Higher-order conflicts remain groups; partial searches never acquire exhaustive acceptance colors.
- A paper sidecar SDK and integrated bucket workbench — restore named personal/RFC world models, full WMT coherent alternatives, version-safe insertion/conflict receipts, forks and explicit workspace replay as the main submission flow.
- Actual PDF text extraction with exact source locators, partial candidate claims, controlled and host-configurable scientific/model parsing, reviewed WMT IR, and an OpenAPI-described local submission API — let papers and computational evidence enter a reviewable language pipeline.
- Exact-bound computational proof artifacts, a real nonvacuous WMT/Z3 entailment checker, extensible verifier hooks, typed SDK exports and tested Castalia publication projections — distinguish attached code from checked evidence without inventing publication or proof authority.
- A knowledge-graph entity experiment with typed, inherited schemas, runnable OCaml equals overrides, graph-aware policies and exact/cosine embedding comparisons. Ground Z3 claims and saved alternatives retain distinct entity IDs and snapshot provenance; unknown comparisons assert no match consequence.
- Entity contract tests and real-browser coverage for policy inheritance, nontransitive similarity, incompatible spaces, graph relationships, errors, re-execution and both OCaml backends.
- A browser kernel experiment using Isabelle-exported veri7vn OCaml, editable replacement kernels and comparisons, conditional Z3 consequences, and saved alternatives — to test executable domain models without coupling claim reasoning to one implementation.
- Reproducible proof/export builds, runtime source notices, and exact-number/browser checks — to make the experiment's behavior and proof boundaries reviewable.

### Changed

- Schedule the SDK's independent Z3/Wasm test files sequentially in CI so bounded solver fixtures do not compete with HTTP/contract workers; include the exact stop reason in lattice-test failures.
- Run Node SDK/Wasm checks and browser/Wasm suites in separate CI jobs, with runner resource diagnostics — keep the new backend workload from sharing the browser's thread budget and make resource failures inspectable.
- Updated the Playwright test runner and pinned its dependency lock — the previous browser download hosts no longer resolve, and the kernel experiment needs current Wasm-GC browser coverage.
